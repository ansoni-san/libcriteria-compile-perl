CHANGE LOG
----------------------------

[Version 0.2]

Module now functional. OOH-RAH!

- Added Makefile and CPAN META files
- Added MANIFEST file
- Added short readme from excepts of POD
- Fixed Build.PL syntax error preventing build

- Completed support for newer criteria API
- Added access mode implementation / API
- Added smart-handling of subroutine-by-name and subroutine-by-ref handler directives
- Added smart match 'matches' criteria support
- Added initial project POD documentation
- Fixed issue with accidental regression causing lost localiation of $_ in handlers and causing only first run to succeed
- Removed remnants of old clear mode of the compile method

- Experimental sub flattening ready for test with the follow caveats:
	- the optimisation is heavy at initialisation
	- slows down criteria compilation by almost 1 second
	- improves speed of repeated evaluation of criteria by reducing calls during criteria exec by 40%
